### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm SoftwarePleb, 

A Full Stack Software Eningeer. At Work I mostly use C#, Javascript and Powershell.

In my own time I've been working in languages like c, python and r.

A big motivation for coding is learning so natuarally I prefer to use different languages and projects than I make at work.

-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an http server written in c.

-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on c or go projects.

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning x64 assembly.

-âš¡ Fun fact: There are only two doubly-landlocked countries in the world, meaning they are a landlocked country surrounded on all sides by landlocked countries. They are Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan.

-ðŸ“« How to reach me: softwarepleb99@gmail.com.
